# Introduction {.unnumbered}

[TO BE UPDATED] Each research question draws its own challenges which are unique in themselves. Our aim here is to provide a workflow which answers and / or prompts the large scale questions that should be asked at each stage of the process. We point to resources, methods and facilities that may be useful in answering a particular question. We assume some knowledge of statistical inference and it limitations. The validity and appropriateness of a particular method is dependent on the individual researcher(s). This workflow is focused on the statistical programming language R, as an environment where the complete analysis workflow can take place and can be documented in a fully reproducible way. However, we also point to other tools that can be used at different stages, and ways to import and export the data from and to those tools.

Biodiversity resources are increasingly international. We focus on biodiversity data and resources from Sweden but our aim is to present considerations and methods that can be applied beyond Sweden's borders.

General description of the workflow here. Data-->Cleaning-->Fitness evaluation-->Analysis always exploring and filtering the data in light of the research question. Also say here that if known from before, the cleaning and filtering criteria can be set directly on the query!

The SBDI4R package is primarily for accessing data. It includes some filter functions that allow you to filter prior to download. It also includes some simple summary functions, and some function for some simple data exploration. The examples also show you how you can use the data by continued exploring and analyzing using other R package.

Please get in contact with us via the [support center](https://docs.biodiversitydata.se/support/) if you have questions regarding the use of the SBDI4R package.

## Package configuration

Lets assume you have already installed the package as shown in the main [site](https://biodiversitydata-se.github.io/SBDI4R).

The SBDI4R package must be loaded for each new R session:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(SBDI4R)
sbdi_config(caching="off")
```

However, the options you stored in .Rprofile if you did it so, will load automatically with the package.

## Customizing SBDI4R

Various aspects of the SBDI4R package can be customized.

### Caching

SBDI4R can cache most results to local files. This means that if the
same code is run multiple times, the second and subsequent iterations
will be faster. This will also reduce load on the web servers. By
default, this caching is session-based, meaning that the local files are
stored in a temporary directory that is automatically deleted when the R
session is ended. This behaviour can be altered so that caching is
permanent, by setting the caching directory to a non-temporary location.
For example, under Windows, use something like:

```{r}
sbdi_config(cache_directory = file.path("c:","mydata","sbdi_cache")) ## Windows
```

or for Linux:

```{r}
sbdi_config(cache_directory = "~/mydata/sbdi_cache") ## Linux
```

Note that this directory must exist (you need to create it yourself).

All results will be stored in that cache directory and will be used from
one session to the next. They won't be re-downloaded from the server
unless the user specifically deletes those files or changes the caching
setting to "refresh".

If you change the cache_directory to a permanent location, you may wish
to add something like this to your .Rprofile file, so that it happens
automatically each time the SBDI4R package is loaded:

```{r}
setHook(packageEvent("SBDI4R", "onLoad"), 
        function(...) sbdi_config(cache_directory=file.path("~","mydata","sbdi_cache")))
```

Caching can also be turned off entirely by:

```{r}
sbdi_config(caching="off")
```

or set to "refresh", meaning that the cached results will re-downloaded
from the SBDI servers and the cache updated. (This will happen for as
long as caching is set to "refresh" â€” so you may wish to switch back to
normal "on" caching behaviour once you have updated your cache with the
data you are working on).

### User-agent string

Each request to SBDI servers is accompanied by a "user-agent" string
that identifies the software making the request. This is a standard
behaviour used by web browsers as well. The user-agent identifies the
user requests to SBDI, helping SBDI to adapt and enhance the services
that it provides. By default, the SBDI4R user-agent string is set to
"SBDI4R" plus the SBDI4R version number (e.g. "SBDI4R 1.0").

### E-mail address

Each request to SBDI servers is also accompanied by an "e-mail address"
string that identifies the user making the request. This is a standard
behaviour used by web browsers as well. There is no default for this
field. You can provide your e-mail address as a parameter directly to
each call of the function occurrences(), or you can set it once per
session specifying it in the package configuration:

```{r}
sbdi_config(email="your.valid@emailaddress.com")
```

*NO* other personal identification information is sent. You can see all
configuration settings, including the the user-agent string that is
being used, with the command:

```{r}
sbdi_config()
```

### Debugging

If things aren't working as expected, more detail (particularly about
web requests and caching behaviour) can be obtained by setting the
verbose configuration option:

```{r}
sbdi_config(verbose=TRUE)
```

### Setting the download reason

SBDI requires that you provide a reason when downloading occurrence data
(via the SBDI4R `occurrences()` function). You can provide this as a
parameter directly to each call of `occurrences()`, or you can set it
once per session using:

```{r}
sbdi_config(download_reason_id=your_reason_id)
```

(See `sbdi_reasons()` for valid download reasons, e.g.
download_reason_id=10 for "testing", or 7 for "ecological research", 8
for "systematic research/taxonomy", 3 for "education")

### Other options

If you make a request that returns an empty result set (e.g. an
un-matched name), by default you will simply get an empty data structure
returned to you without any special notification. If you would like to
be warned about empty result sets, you can use:

```{r}
sbdi_config(warn_on_empty=TRUE)
```


## Other packages needed for this tutorial
Then, check that we have some additional packages that we'll use in the examples, and install them if necessary.

```{r, message=FALSE}
to_install <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "jpeg", "leaflet","maps", "mapdata",
                "maptools", "sp", "rgeos", "tidyr", "vegan")
to_install <- to_install[!sapply(to_install, requireNamespace, quietly=TRUE)]
if(length(to_install)>0)
    install.packages(to_install, repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```
