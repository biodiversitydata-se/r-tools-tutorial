# Introduction {.unnumbered}

<img src="sbdi-logo-orginal-large.png" class="cover" width="250" style="float: right;"/> Biodiversity resources are increasingly international. The SBDI has made an effort to canalise biodiversity data and resources to help the research community access and analyse Swedish primary biodiversity data. Each research question draws its own challenges which are unique in themselves. Our aim here is to provide a few examples that prompt questions that may be asked at different stages of the process. The validity and appropriateness of a particular method depends on the individual researcher(s). For a comprehensive workflow on how to treat and analyse primary biodiversity data please refer to our tutorial on [biodiversity analysis tools](https://github.com/biodiversitydata-se/biodiversity-analysis-tools) where we go through the complete workflow Data --\> Cleaning --\> Fitness evaluation --\> Analysis

## R and Mirroreum {.unnumbered}

The present tutorial is focused on the statistical programming language R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics that is widely used within the scientific community and where the complete analysis workflow can be documented in a fully reproducible way.

At SBDI we provide access for researchers and students to [Mirroreum](https://mirroreum.biodiversitydata.se/) -- an online web-based environment for Reproducible Open Research in the area of biodiversity analysis. Mirroreum is based on a Free and Open Source stack of software. Logging in, you immediately get access to a web-based version of R Studio with a large number of pre-installed packages such as all the packages offered from ROpenSci and more.

Compared to running R Studio on your own machine, Mirroreum offers more computational resources and a standardized environment where you can rely on all the relevant packages being installed and the configuration parameters being set appropriately. To know more about Mirroreum or to request an account please visit the [SBDI documentation site](https://docs.biodiversitydata.se/analyse-data/mirroreum/)

## sbdi4r2 - a new R ðŸ“¦ to search an access data {.unnumbered}

The sbdi4r2 package enables the R community to directly access data and resources hosted by SBDI. The goal is to enable observations of species to be queried and output in a range of standard formats. It includes some filter functions that allow you to filter prior to download. It also includes some simple summary functions, and some function for some simple data exploration. The examples included in this tutorial also show you how you can continue exploring and analyzing using other R package.

Please refer to the [package documentation](https://biodiversitydata-se.github.io/sbdi4r2) for details on how to install it. Once installed the sbdi4r2 package must be loaded for each new R session:

```{r loadshow, eval=FALSE}
library(sbdi4r2)
```

```{r start00, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(sbdi4r2)
sbdi_config(email = "sbdi4r-test@biodiversitydata.se", 
            download_reason_id = 10)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(BIRDS)
```

Various aspects of the sbdi4r2 package can be customized.

#### E-mail address {.unnumbered}

Each download request to SBDI servers is also accompanied by an "e-mail address" string that identifies the user making the request. You will need to provide an email address registered with the SBDI. You can create an account [here](https://auth.biodiversitydata.se/cas/login). Once an email is registered with the SBDI, it should be stored in the config:

```{r config, eval=FALSE}
sbdi_config(email = "your.registered@emailaddress.com")
```

Else you can provide this e-mail address as a parameter directly to each call of the function occurrences().

#### Setting the download reason {.unnumbered}

SBDI requires that you provide a reason when downloading occurrence data (via the sbdi4r2 `atlas_occurrences()` function). You can provide this as a parameter directly to each call of `atlas_occurrences()`, or you can set it once per session using:

```{r config2, eval=FALSE}
sbdi_config(download_reason_id = "your_reason_id")
```

(See `sbdi_reasons()` for valid download reasons, e.g. \* 3 for "education", \* 7 for "ecological research", \* 8 for "systematic research/taxonomy", \* 10 for "testing")

#### Privacy {.unnumbered}

***NO*** other personal identification information is sent. You can see all configuration settings, including the the user-agent string that is being used, with the command:

```{r config3, eval=FALSE}
sbdi_config()
```

## Other packages needed {.unnumbered}

Some additional packages are needed for these examples. Install them if necessary with the following script:

```{r packages, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
to_install <- c("colorRamps", "cowplot","dplyr",
                "ggplot2", "leaflet", "maps", "mapdata", 
                "remotes", "sf", "tidyr", "xts")
to_install <- to_install[!sapply(to_install, 
                                 requireNamespace, 
                                 quietly = TRUE)]
if (length(to_install) > 0)
    install.packages(to_install, 
                     repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

remotes::install_github("Greensway/BIRDS")
```

## Your collaboration is appreciated {.unnumbered}

Open Source also means that you can contribute. You don't need to know how to program but every input is appreciated. Did you find something that is not working? Have suggestions for examples or text? you can always
