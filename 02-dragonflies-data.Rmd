#Case 2:
Look at opportunistically collected citizen science data – using the big Swedish cit science species observation data portal Artportalen.

We want to look at dragonflies – but before we can use the observation records we need to know how the observation effort has varied over time and in space. For this we define field visits i.e. occasions at which an observer has sampled observations – if we have information on observer id, location id and date we can aggregate data into “field visits”. We do this using BIRDS, and 25km grid:
Select data – get records for Southern Sweden (Götaland) and years 2000-2010.
How has observation effort (frequency of visits) varied over time and space? – 1) show maps as in Example 7 (all years, year 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010), 2 make also a time line plot with no. visits against years, no. of gridcells with visits against years.

We can now look at some particular species and ask whether this has changed in occurrence over time:
Plot no. records of species x and no. visits all species over years (we simply explore by comparing records for a species with no visits, can assume that species has increased of stronger positive trend than for no. visits)
Plot no. gridcells with visits for species x and no. gridcells with visits for all species over years (we simply explore by comparing records for a species with no visits, can assume that species has increased of stronger positive trend than for no. visits)
(species x: Tvåfläckad trollslända Epitheca bimaculata)
