<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Case 1: Example with fish data from NORS</h1>
<p>In this example we are interested in exploring data from a specific data resource – Sjöprovfiskedatabasen NORS (Institutionen för akvatiska resurser, SLU). This data base has 2.8 M observations starting in the 1950’s.</p>
<p>As you may already know, SBDI is a collection of many biodiversity databases. We start by searching for the data resource we are interested in using the function <code>pick_filter()</code>. This is an interactive query guiding you through the many resources available to filtering your query (data resources, spatial layers, and curated species lists).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="case-1-example-with-fish-data-from-nors.html#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>fq_str <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">pick_filter</span>(<span class="st">&quot;resource&quot;</span>) </span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="case-1-example-with-fish-data-from-nors.html#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="do">## follow the instructions </span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Follow the instruction. Your choices here would have been “in3” –&gt; “dr20.” Your variable <code>fq_str</code> will now contain a string “data_resource_uid:dr20.”</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="case-1-example-with-fish-data-from-nors.html#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="do">## we cant do it interactive here so we force it</span></span>

<p>But we are not interested in the complete database, but on the last 10 years of data. for this we concatenate (add to a vector) another filter string. These will be treated as AND factors.</p>

<p>For references on how to use the filters see documentation at <a href="link">docs</a>.</p>
<p>Using the function <code>occurrences()</code> we can the query for the observations fulfilling our filter. If you haven’t specified that in the <code>sbdi_config()</code> before (see <a href="case-1-example-with-fish-data-from-nors.html#case-1-example-with-fish-data-from-nors">Case 1: Example with fish data from NORS</a> Installation), you need to pass your email and the download reason.</p>

<p>Let’s now ask: how does the species richness vary across Sweden? In this case we want to summarise occurrences species-wise over a defined grid instead of plotting every observation point. First we need to overlay the observations with a grid. In this case, the standard Swedish grids at 50, 25, 10 and 5 km are provided as data in the SBDI4R package (with Coordinate Reference System = WGS84, EPSG:4326).</p>
